# MiniStack

MiniStack aims to provide a simple but powerful tool for you to test your AWS-based applications.

This application was born because most AWS-fake tools are either not mature or too complex to use/extend.

MiniStack uses only one language and codebase, which enables the development to be easy and pleasant.

Be aware that this tool is not meant for production use. Not now, not ever. **MiniStack is designed for testing purposes only.**
